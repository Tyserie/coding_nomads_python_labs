'''
Write a script that takes in a number from the user as input and prints the following structure.

Suppose the input is 5, you will output
*
* *
* * * 
* * * *
* * * * * 
i.e. number of rows will be 5, 1st row will have 1 star, 2nd row will have 2 stars, 3rd row 3 stars, 4th row will have 4 stars and 5th row will have 5 stars.

Another example: if input is 3, you will output
*
* *
* * *

Hint: Think of nested for loops

'''
usr_inp = int(input("Please chose a number: "))

for row in range(1, usr_inp + 1):
    for column in range(row):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()
